<h2>Hello, Reader</h2>
	
	<p align="center">My name is Daniel Ali. I am 21 years old and I live in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.
	I am currently studying at Rogers State University, and also work in the Bartlesville Public Schools
	district as a substitute teacher. I can teach from K-12. Throughout my life, I have had one hobby that has stood out.</p>
	
	<p align="center">This hobby is video gaming. From my early years, when I was five years old, I have played video games
	of all sorts. I started with flash games on cartoon network and newgrounds, and graduated to more "mature"<br>
	games when I got Quake 3, and the early Call of Duty games on my PC. That is another thing I should add;<br>
	I have always been a PC gamer and will always be one. Some of my hobbies besides video games are: exercising<br>
	learning how to code, and cooking. I also like to watch movies on Netflix and to read.</p>
